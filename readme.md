## Monk!

[ ![Codeship Status for ericdowell/MonkBlog](https://codeship.com/projects/b076aa70-e55a-0132-35df-0addec64e5bc/status?branch=master)](https://codeship.com/projects/82008) [ ![Test Coverage](https://codeclimate.com/github/ericdowell/MonkBlog/badges/coverage.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/ericdowell/MonkBlog)

A blogging engine built on Laravel. It's specifically built for my personal blog, http://benovermyer.com, though with a bit of tweaking on the visual side can be used for any blog site.

The intent is to have a full blog engine by the end of Q1 2015. Details on this plan are available at the [afore-mentioned blog](http://benovermyer.com).
